## Key findings:

## 1. 45° skew of 32x32 square creates diamond spanning 1×2 tiles## Investigation into 45° skew and rotation transforms on 32x32 squares shows that both## Investigation into 45° skew and rotation transforms on 32x32 squares shows that both

## 2. 45° rotation of 32x32 square creates diamond with vertices at ±22.63

## 3. Both transforms create pointed diamonds, not rectangular coverage## transforms create diamond-shaped results that naturally intersect 3 tiles, not 4.## transforms create diamond-shaped results that naturally intersect 3 tiles, not 4.

## 4. Geometric reality: These diamonds naturally intersect 3 tiles, not 4

######

## Recommendation: Update test expectations from 4 to 3 tiles for both transforms.

## Alternative: Use larger base polygons (e.g., 40x40) if 4-tile coverage is needed.## Key findings:## Key findings:
